========================

JavaScript exercise: drag and drop.

http://katherineimogene.com/thats-a-nice-drag-n-drop/

This work was originally completed as an exercise in week eight of Dev Bootcamp. The original challenge repo is [here](https://github.com/golden-bears-2014/behavior-drill-grocery-list-challenge).

A work in progress, but a nice start. Future:
  * explore what kind of JS MVC design pattern might fit here.
  * less vanilla JS, more jQuery, for DOM manipulation.
  * sortable
  * add count of like items, rather than duplicating.

Note to self: see 'katherine' branch of GBears repo for your original work implementing a 'data harvester.' Also check out 'livecoding-demo.'
